<H1>Weaponizing NetMan DLL Hijacking gone wrong?</H1>  

<p>In my hunt for OSCP certificate I was going through Windows Priviledge escalation techniques. Specifically DLL hijacking. I stumbled upon an <a href="https://twitter.com/itm4n">@itm4n</a>'s great article about <a href="https://itm4n.github.io/windows-server-netman-dll-hijacking/">NetMan DLL Hijacking</a>.</p>

<p>his article explains how all editions of Windows Server, from 2008R2 to 2019 should be prone to DLL Hijacking in the %PATH% directories.
